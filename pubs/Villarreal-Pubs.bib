  VOLUME = {24},
  YEAR = {2013},
  ABSTRACT = {This mixed-method study addressed the “foreign TA problem,” reconceptualizing it as the \textit{communication gap}, an issue created by multiple parties—including bias originating from undergraduates. Experimental sessions measured undergraduates’ comprehension of 2 brief lessons taught by an international professor. Between lessons, participants completed 1 of 3 short modules: a bias-stimulation module, a control module, or a linguistic-training module (which confronted both accent misunderstanding and accent bias). While training did not affect comprehension, questionnaire responses revealed a positive effect of training on sociolinguistic attitudes. Follow-up discussion sessions explored undergraduates’ experiences with international faculty and responses to the communication gap. Several important themes emerged from these discussions, including effects on academic plans, negative cognitive effects, and a model of undergraduates’ socialization into accent bias. The article concludes with recommendations specifically geared toward TESOL professionals’ ongoing efforts to close the communication gap, including a greater recognition of undergraduates’ role in perpetuating the gap.},

  ABSTRACT = {This study investigates the L2 identities of native English-speaking intermediate-level Spanish learners by combining two methods, production and metapragmatic judgments, and focusing on T/V address forms (tú and usted). Twelve intermediate-level Spanish learners interacted with Spanish speakers in oral role-play scenarios designed to elicit different address forms. Learners answered a questionnaire one week later about desired address form use in various interactional scenarios (which were matched with role-play scenarios). An analysis of questionnaire judgments revealed that these learners were both cognizant of the second-order indexical potential of T/V address forms and determined to utilize this indexical potential to construct notions of their desired L2 identities. Conversely, learners’ address-form production exhibited an overgeneralization of T, a result that starkly contrasts with the overgeneralization of V found in previous studies. Whereas some learners failed to consistently produce their desired address forms, compromising their selfconstructed ideal L2 identities, others showed an adeptness at matching their production to their judgments. I thus suggest that future research on L2 pragmatics and L2 identity move beyond a focus on L2 pragmatic competence and toward a consideration of learners’ indexical awareness and agency.},

  TITLE = {The construction of social meaning: {A} matched-guise investigation of the {California} {Vowel} {Shift}},
  TYPE = {{PhD} dissertation},
  YEAR = {2016},
  ABSTRACT = {Research on social meaning, which links language variation to the wider social world, often bases claims about the social meanings of linguistic forms on production (i.e., speakers’ situational use of meaningful forms). In the case of the California Vowel Shift (CVS), an ongoing restructuring of the vowel system of California English that takes place below the level of conscious awareness, previous production research has suggested that the CVS carries social meanings of carefreeness, femininity, and privilege. Left unclear in these production-based claims is whether listeners actually pick up on and recognize the social meanings that speakers apparently utilize the CVS to transmit. In this research, a dialect recognition task with matched guises (California-shifted vs. conservative) forms the basis for exploring Californian listeners’ reactions to the CVS, and how these reactions are mediated by perceptions of dialect geography. In short, this research focuses on listeners’ reactions to the CVS in order to address a more fundamental question: How do listeners and speakers together participate in the construction of social meaning?

Stimuli for the main study task were drawn from excerpts of sociolinguistic interviews with 12 lifelong California English speakers from three regions of the state: the San Francisco Bay Area, Lower Central Valley, and Southern California. Guises were created from interview excerpts by modifying the F2 of each TRAP and GOOSE token via source-filter resynthesis methods. Californian guises featured backed TRAP and fronted GOOSE; conservative guises featured fronted TRAP and backed GOOSE. Ninety-seven Californians participated in a perceptual task in which they attempted to identify speakers’ regional origin and rated speakers on affective scales. The results indicated that Californians recognize the CVS as Californian, as California-shifted guises were less likely to be identified as from outside California (but more likely to be identified as from Southern California). Listeners rated California-shifted guises higher on the scales \textit{Californian}, \textit{sounds like a Valley girl}, and \textit{confident}, indicating a core of social meanings indexed by the CVS. Among listeners from the San Francisco Bay Area, the CVS indexes masculinity, but among Southern California listeners, the CVS indexes femininity. Listeners from across California also rated speakers who they believed to be from the same region as them higher on \textit{Californian}, \textit{familiar}, and \textit{sounds like me}.

This research demonstrates that the social meanings of linguistic forms do not reside only in speakers’ situational use of these forms, as listeners did not associate the CVS with carefreeness, femininity, or privilege, the social meanings of the CVS suggested by previous studies of California English production; instead, I propose an account of the indexical field that links perception and production by placing the core social meanings of the CVS uncovered by this research (Californian identity, sounding like a Valley girl, and confidence) at the center of the CVS’s indexical field. This research also contributes to theory in perceptual dialectology and language change. In order to explain this study’s finding that the CVS is associated with Southern California, this research introduces the perceptual-dialectological process of centrality: the identification of speakers who are believed to most exemplify the speech of a given region. Finally, this research suggests an attitudinal stance that allows changes from below such as the CVS to flourish: speakers are aware of the change in the community (at a tacit level, if not consciously) but do not believe that they are participating in the change.},

  ABSTRACT = {Past production research on the California Vowel Shift (CVS) has suggested that the CVS carries social meanings of carefreeness, Whiteness, femininity, and privilege (e.g., Eckert 2008b), but it is unclear whether these social meanings reflect listener perceptions. In the present study, Californian listeners heard speech samples, guessed where speakers were from, and rated speakers on language attitudes scales; stimuli in this task were matched guises differing by speakers’ use of two CVS features. The results indicated that listeners associate these features with Californianness, sounding like a Valley girl, and (for male speakers) confidence, complicating the social meanings suggested by production studies. I discuss these results in terms of how interaction context guides the perception of social meaning by activating subsets of the indexical field. This research also introduces two innovative methods for investigating sociolinguistic perception: stimuli created using resynthesized vowels within spontaneous speech produced by multiple speakers, and statistical inference via Bayesian hierarchical modeling.},

  YEAR = {2018},
  ABSTRACT = {(First paragraph) Recent research in perceptual sociolinguistics has investigated a host of variables—primarily segmental—to assess the extent to which social meanings are constructed in perception similarly to the way they are constructed in ongoing production. Despite production research in sociolinguistics that has demonstrated how speakers use intonational variation to index various ethnic identities and social stances (Burdin 2015, Holliday 2016, Reed 2016), there has been a general lack of perceptual research on the social meanings of intonational variables. In addition, while research has demonstrated US listeners’ ability to distinguish African American and white voices (cf. Thomas and Reaser 2004), these studies have also revealed challenges inherent in isolating speaker-specific variables that drive ethnic identification (Holliday and Jaggers 2015); indeed, there has been little research in prosody more generally in non-standard varieties of English (Burdin, Holliday, and Reed 2018). In the present study, we address these gaps in research by investigating the extent to which listeners perceive specific aspects of intonational variation as indexing ethnic identity.},

  YEAR = {2019},
  ABSTRACT = {(First paragraph) This chapter examines coronal stop deletion (CSD) in the speech of residents of North Town, a rural, majority Mexican American community south of San Antonio. CSD has been studied since the earliest days of sociolinguistics (e.g., Wolfram 1969; Labov et al. 1968), including in varieties of Chicano English (e.g., Galindo 1987; Santa Ana 1991, 1992, 1996; Bayley 1994a, 1997; Coetzee 2004), and the main constraints on the variable are well documented (Labov 1989; Schreier 2005; Hazen 2011). Precisely because CSD has been so widely studied, examination of this variable enables us to compare constraint effects between well-documented varieties and varieties that have received less attention (cf. Wolfram, Childs, and Torbert 2000; Torbert 2001; Hazen 2011). Moreover, previous studies in Latino communities have focused on urban populations in New York, Austin, San Antonio, and Los Angeles. By contrast, this study examines this variable in the very different conditions of a rural community where Mexican Americans comprise more than 85 percent of the population, while Anglos comprise only 10 percent (for background on North Town, see Foley 1990, and Chapter 2, this volume). Although CSD has been very extensively studied, this classic variable continues to serve as a useful diagnostic for examining dialect differences, particularly in dialects where language contact is involved. This study provides a look into the situation of CSD in dialect contact in a rural majority minority community and compares the results for this well-studied variable with studies conducted among Mexican Americans in urban areas and with speakers of other contact varieties of English.},

A random forest classifier was trained on 180 acoustic measures from 5,355 tokens of /r/ (hand-coded as Present or Absent) in a variety of English with variable rhoticity; the classifier achieved 87.9\% accuracy on training data. The classifier was then used to predict the probability of /r/ presence in 32,099 additional tokens from the same variety.

Eleven phonetically trained listeners judged 60 classifier-coded tokens as Present or Absent. Judgment results indicated a significant positive linear relationship between classifier probability and human judgments; classifier probability also outperformed individual acoustic measures (e.g., F3 minimum) in predicting human judgments. These results both validate this random forest classifier method for automated coding of sociophonetic variables and indicate the viability of modelling phonetic variation using classifier probability},

  ABSTRACT = {The current study examines how listeners make gradient and variable ethnolinguistic judgments in an experimental context where the speaker’s identity is well-known. It features an openguise experiment (Soukup, 2013) that assessed whether sociolinguistic judgments are subject to incrementality, with judgments increasing in magnitude as variable stimuli demonstrate more extreme differences. In particular, this task tested whether judgments of President Barack Obama as sounding ‘more’ or ‘less’ black (e.g., Alim \& Smitherman, 2012) are sensitive to differences in intonation. Half of critical stimuli featured an L+H* pitch accent, which occurs more frequently in African American Language than in Mainstream U.S. English (Holliday, 2016). Four stimuli apiece were created from these phrases by making each pitch accent more extreme by semitonebased F0 steps. Seventy-nine listeners rated these stimuli via the question, “How black does Obama sound here?” Mixed-effects modeling indicated that listeners rated more phonetically extreme L+H* stimuli as sounding blacker, regardless of listener identity. A post-hoc analysis found that listeners attended to different voice quality features in L+H* stimuli. We discuss implications for research in intonation, ethnic identification, incrementality, language attitudes, and sociolinguistic awareness.},

  VOLUME = {11},
  YEAR = {2020},
  ABSTRACT = {The time-consuming nature of coding sociophonetic variables that are typically treated as categorical represents an impediment to addressing research questions around these variables that require large volumes of data. In this paper, we apply a machine learning method, random forest classification (Breiman, 2001), to automate coding (categorical prediction) of two English sociophonetic variables traditionally treated as categorical, non-prevocalic /r/ and word-medial intervocalic /t/, based on tokens’ acoustic signatures. We found good performance for binary classifiers of non-prevocalic /r/ (Absent versus Present) and medial /t/ (Voiced versus Voiceless), but not for medial /t/ with a six-way coding distinction (largely due to some codes being sparsely represented in the training data). This method also yields rankings of acoustic measures in terms of importance in classification. Beyond any individual measures, this method generates probabilistic predictions of variation (classifier probabilities) that represent a composite of the acoustic cues fed into the model. In a listening experiment, we found that not only did classifier probabilities significantly capture gradience in trained listeners’ perceptions of rhoticity, they better predicted listeners’ perceptions than individual acoustic measures. This method thus represents a new approach to reconciling the categorical and continuous dimensions of sociophonetic variation.},

  ABSTRACT = {While the retraction of trap is found throughout the American West, it is primarily associated with California and supposed Californian values in both the popular media and the ears of Californian listeners. This study investigates the local construction of meaning for a supralocal sound change by examining perceptions of trap backing in Kansas, a locale that has also undergone front lax vowel retraction. Thirty-five college students heard matched-guise stimuli differing only by trap F2, guessed speakers’ regional origin, and rated speakers on 14 affective scales. Listeners associated trap backing with California (despite local participation in the sound shift) and general prestige. The authors suggest that this association with general prestige may help to explain the presence of this vowel shift in Kansas despite considerable ideological differences with California. They argue that these results highlight the interaction between local construction of meaning and broader national discourses for a sound change: while stereotypical associations with a sound change can spread rapidly through means like popular media, stance and identity associations are constructed at the local level.},

In particular, women and men are thought to differ only in their rates of variable usage, not in the constraints governing their variation; that is, women and men are typically considered to belong to the same speech community. We find that in early twentieth century Southland, New Zealand, women and men had different constraint hierarchies for rhoticity, with a community grammar of rhoticity only developing later. These results may be a product of a particular set of sociohistorical facts thatare not peculiar to Southland. We suggest that further research in other geographical locations may indeed reveal that men and women have different constraint hierarchies for other variables. Speech communities may thus be delimited along social lines in ways that have not been previously considered.},

  VOLUME = {65},
  YEAR = {2022},
  ABSTRACT = {A growing body of research in psycholinguistics, corpus linguistics, and sociolinguistics shows that we have a strong tendency to repeat linguistic material that we have recently produced, seen, or heard. The present paper investigates whether priming effects manifest in continuous phonetic variation the way it has been reported in phonological, morphological, and syntactic variation. We analyzed nearly 60,000 tokens of vowels involved in the New Zealand English short front vowel shift (SFVS), a change in progress in which trap/dress move in the opposite direction to kit, from a topic-controlled corpus of monologues (166 speakers), to test for effects that are characteristic of priming phenomena: repetition, decay, and lexical boost. Our analysis found evidence for all three effects. Tokens that were relatively high and front tended to be followed by tokens that were also high and front; the repetition effect weakened with greater time between the prime and target; and the repetition effect was stronger if the prime and target belonged to (different tokens of) the same word. Contrary to our expectations, however, the cross-vowel effects suggest that the repetition effect responded not to the direction of vowel changes within the SFVS, but rather the peripherality of the tokens. We also found an interaction between priming behavior and gender, with stronger repetition effects among men than women. While these findings both indicate that priming manifests in continuous phonetic variation and provide further evidence that priming is among the factors providing structure to intraspeaker variation, they also challenge unitary accounts of priming phenomena.},

  ABSTRACT = {In order for Open Methods to mitigate resource barriers to linguistics research, the Open Methods themselves must not act as or require substantial resource barriers to access and use. We emphasize "substantial" here because there is no such thing as an absence of resource barriers; just because Open Method is freely available online doesn't make it accessible to everyone. To evaluate this aspect of Open Methods, we build on similar widely-used tools in the Open Access space to create a "Spectrum of Open Methods". This tool is not meant to gatekeep open methods; a method that's imperfect but published is always more open than a method that never gets published because it's not perfect yet. Rather, the Spectrum of Open Methods is intended to inspire creators to make adjustments to their resources to make them as open as possible. To illustrate, a Case Study is included where Dan Villarreal has deployed the Spectrum of Open Methods to one of his projects and identified avenues for future development and improvement. We developed this tool while working on a chapter titled "Open Methods: Decolonizing (or not) research methods in linguistics" for the forthcoming volume Decolonizing Linguistics edited by Anne Charity Hudley, Christine Mallinson, and Mary Bucholtz and published by Oxford University Press. We welcome iterations of this Spectrum of Open Methods with edits, adaptations to other fields, or discipline-specific adjustments.},

Despite the co-occurrence of multiple potentially meaningful variables in speech, previous experimental approaches generally focus on single features. This analysis investigated whether machine-learning methods can uncover vowel features that impact sociolinguistic perceptions. Ninety-seven listeners rated short, spontaneous California English stimuli on 12 affective scales; /æ/ and /u/ tokens were manipulated to create “California-shifted” and “unshifted” guises, with other vowels left to vary naturally. Mirroring “bag-of-words” approaches to text corpora, we treated stimuli as “bags of features” based on 11 vowel phonemes. We used the Boruta feature-selection algorithm to assess the importance of these features, plus guise, on affective scale ratings. The most frequently selected variables included both predictable (/æ/) and less well-attested variables (/ʊ/). However, guise was never selected, suggesting it was an overly-coarse axis of relevant variation. We argue that “bottom-up” approaches can model social meanings amid variable co-occurrence.},

  YEAR = {in press},
  ABSTRACT = {(First paragraph) As (socio)linguistic  research makes more space for the study of the linguistic and cultural practices of marginalized communities, more scholars of color are engaging in social and cultural approaches to the study of language. In turn, many (socio)linguists (both scholars of color and allies) are rethinking what the labor of (socio)linguistics ought to be, and to what ends. These conversations have, over the last 10-15 years, led to the present moment, where calls for principles of language and social activism/liberation have given way to actual theories of such that are being proposed.},

  YEAR = {in press},
  ABSTRACT = {Open Methods are resources that pertain to at least one stage in the linguistics research process and are available free of charge to all who can find them (e.g., Boersma \& Weenink 2021; Kendall \& Farrington 2020; Styler 2021). We describe the current state of Open Methods in linguistics, including benefits and structural barriers to further development. Then, in the spirit of "those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it", we discuss how Open Access (a longer-developed cousin to Open Methods that focuses on publishing research) fails to adequately serve research(ers) in the global context despite its agreeable basic premise (Meagher 2021). We critically assess whether Open Methods can help decolonize linguistics research—or whether it merely allows already-privileged linguistics to accrue greater privilege. We ultimately present a cautiously optimistic model for anticolonial Open Methods in linguistics, with recommendations and examples of practices and policies throughout.},
