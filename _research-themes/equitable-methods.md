As linguistics researchers, we often turn to computational methods to speed up and/or scale up what we're doing.
But speed and equity aren't the same thing---in fact, computational methods can actually [**reinforce** existing social structures and inequalities](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1915768117).
I've always been interested in <a href="#critical-socioling" onclick="tablistClickHandle(event, 'tablist-research-themes', 'critical-socioling')">how ideas from sociolinguistics can be used to interrupt power structures</a>, and as my research has turned more computational, I'm increasingly thinking about equity in research methods.
I recently found that <a href="#computational-methods" onclick="tablistClickHandle(event, 'tablist-research-themes', 'computational-methods')">sociolinguistic auto-coders</a> can suffer from biased predictions (e.g., generating more accurate codes for women than men) and evaluated several strategies for mitigating unfairness {% cite villarreal_sociolinguistic_forthcoming --prefix e-m %};
I've also published code that lets you test your own auto-coders' fairness {% cite villarreal_slac-fairness_2023 --prefix e-m %}.
Beyond these technical approaches to fairness, I think we as researchers need to take a close look at our own practices around publishing and using computational methods.
I've worked with my Pitt colleague Lauren Collister to examine the state of <a href="#open-methods" onclick="tablistClickHandle(event, 'tablist-research-themes', 'open-methods')">open methods in linguistics</a> and how to avoid the neocolonial practices that characterize the "open access" movement {% cite villarreal_open_in_press --prefix e-m %}, and created a tool that you can use to assess how open your open methods are {% cite collister_spectrum_2022 --prefix e-m %}.
