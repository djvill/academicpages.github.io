  ABSTRACT = {Attitudes toward languages, which serve as surrogates for attitudes toward groups of people, have important real-world consequences, particularly for speakers of socially stigmatized language varieties, including speakers of non-standard global varieties of English. This article explores those issues with examples both from stigmatized varieties spoken in US communities and World Englishes. Finally, suggestions are offered for teachers to assist students to overcome some of the negative attitudes associated with language varieties that differ from US and British standard English.},

  ABSTRACT = {This paper reviews the study of language across disciplines. We focus on epistemological and methodological frameworks in the study of language broadly within linguistics departments and across disciplinary areas that focuses on the organizational structure across departments, degree programs, organizations, and professions. We then emphasize emerging transdisciplinary trends in the study of language and communication. We highlight pressing research required to re-center humans and the human communicative experience. We use examples from lexical and morphological investigations to illustrate the complexity and relevance of the study of language across areas and paradigms.},

  YEAR = {in press},
  ABSTRACT = {(First paragraph) As (socio)linguistic  research makes more space for the study of the linguistic and cultural practices of marginalized communities, more scholars of color are engaging in social and cultural approaches to the study of language. In turn, many (socio)linguists (both scholars of color and allies) are rethinking what the labor of (socio)linguistics ought to be, and to what ends. These conversations have, over the last 10-15 years, led to the present moment, where calls for principles of language and social activism/liberation have given way to actual theories of such that are being proposed.},

  TITLE = {Open {Methods}: {Decolonizing} (or not) research methods in linguistics},
  YEAR = {in press},
  ABSTRACT = {Open Methods are resources that pertain to at least one stage in the linguistics research process and are available free of charge to all who can find them (e.g., Boersma \& Weenink 2021; Kendall \& Farrington 2020; Styler 2021). We describe the current state of Open Methods in linguistics, including benefits and structural barriers to further development. Then, in the spirit of "those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it", we discuss how Open Access (a longer-developed cousin to Open Methods that focuses on publishing research) fails to adequately serve research(ers) in the global context despite its agreeable basic premise (Meagher 2021). We critically assess whether Open Methods can help decolonize linguistics research—or whether it merely allows already-privileged linguistics to accrue greater privilege. We ultimately present a cautiously optimistic model for anticolonial Open Methods in linguistics, with recommendations and examples of practices and policies throughout.},
