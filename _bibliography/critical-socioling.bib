  ABSTRACT = {This mixed-method study addressed the “foreign TA problem,” reconceptualizing it as the \textit{communication gap}, an issue created by multiple parties—including bias originating from undergraduates. Experimental sessions measured undergraduates’ comprehension of 2 brief lessons taught by an international professor. Between lessons, participants completed 1 of 3 short modules: a bias-stimulation module, a control module, or a linguistic-training module (which confronted both accent misunderstanding and accent bias). While training did not affect comprehension, questionnaire responses revealed a positive effect of training on sociolinguistic attitudes. Follow-up discussion sessions explored undergraduates’ experiences with international faculty and responses to the communication gap. Several important themes emerged from these discussions, including effects on academic plans, negative cognitive effects, and a model of undergraduates’ socialization into accent bias. The article concludes with recommendations specifically geared toward TESOL professionals’ ongoing efforts to close the communication gap, including a greater recognition of undergraduates’ role in perpetuating the gap.},

  ABSTRACT = {Attitudes toward languages, which serve as surrogates for attitudes toward groups of people, have important real-world consequences, particularly for speakers of socially stigmatized language varieties, including speakers of non-standard global varieties of English. This article explores those issues with examples both from stigmatized varieties spoken in US communities and World Englishes. Finally, suggestions are offered for teachers to assist students to overcome some of the negative attitudes associated with language varieties that differ from US and British standard English.},

  YEAR = {in press},
  ABSTRACT = {(First paragraph) As (socio)linguistic  research makes more space for the study of the linguistic and cultural practices of marginalized communities, more scholars of color are engaging in social and cultural approaches to the study of language. In turn, many (socio)linguists (both scholars of color and allies) are rethinking what the labor of (socio)linguistics ought to be, and to what ends. These conversations have, over the last 10-15 years, led to the present moment, where calls for principles of language and social activism/liberation have given way to actual theories of such that are being proposed.},
