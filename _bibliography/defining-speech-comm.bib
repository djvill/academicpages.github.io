  ABSTRACT = {(First paragraph) This chapter examines coronal stop deletion (CSD) in the speech of residents of North Town, a rural, majority Mexican American community south of San Antonio. CSD has been studied since the earliest days of sociolinguistics (e.g., Wolfram 1969; Labov et al. 1968), including in varieties of Chicano English (e.g., Galindo 1987; Santa Ana 1991, 1992, 1996; Bayley 1994a, 1997; Coetzee 2004), and the main constraints on the variable are well documented (Labov 1989; Schreier 2005; Hazen 2011). Precisely because CSD has been so widely studied, examination of this variable enables us to compare constraint effects between well-documented varieties and varieties that have received less attention (cf. Wolfram, Childs, and Torbert 2000; Torbert 2001; Hazen 2011). Moreover, previous studies in Latino communities have focused on urban populations in New York, Austin, San Antonio, and Los Angeles. By contrast, this study examines this variable in the very different conditions of a rural community where Mexican Americans comprise more than 85 percent of the population, while Anglos comprise only 10 percent (for background on North Town, see Foley 1990, and Chapter 2, this volume). Although CSD has been very extensively studied, this classic variable continues to serve as a useful diagnostic for examining dialect differences, particularly in dialects where language contact is involved. This study provides a look into the situation of CSD in dialect contact in a rural majority minority community and compares the results for this well-studied variable with studies conducted among Mexican Americans in urban areas and with speakers of other contact varieties of English.},

  YEAR = {2021},
  ABSTRACT = {The existence of a shared constraint hierarchy is one of the criteria that defines and delimits speech communities. In particular, women and men are thought to differ only in their rates of variable usage, not in the constraints governing their variation; that is, women and men are typically considered to belong to the same speech community. We find that in early twentieth century Southland, New Zealand, women and men had different constraint hierarchies for rhoticity, with a community grammar of rhoticity only developing later. These results may be a product of a particular set of sociohistorical facts thatare not peculiar to Southland. We suggest that further research in other geographical locations may indeed reveal that men and women have different constraint hierarchies for other variables. Speech communities may thus be delimited along social lines in ways that have not been previously considered.},
